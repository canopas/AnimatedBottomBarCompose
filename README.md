## Sample Usage

Integrating **AnimatedBottomBarCompose** into your Android app is a breeze! Follow these simple
steps to get started:

1. First, set up your navigation controller:

```
val navController = rememberNavController()
val navBackStackEntry by navController.currentBackStackEntryAsState()
val currentRoute = navBackStackEntry?.destination?.route
val navigationItems = MainNavigation::class.nestedClasses.map {
    it.objectInstance as MainNavigation
}
var selectedItem by remember { mutableIntStateOf(0) }
```

2. Next, add **AnimatedBottomBarCompose** to your app's Scaffold as the bottom bar:

```
Scaffold(
    bottomBar = {
        AnimatedBottomBar(
            selectedItem = selectedItem,
            itemSize = navigationItems.take(3).size,
            containerColor = Color.LightGray,
            indicatorStyle = IndicatorStyle.LINE
        ) {
            navigationItems.forEachIndexed { index, navigationItem ->
                BottomBarItem(
                    selected = currentRoute == navigationItem.route,
                    onClick = {
                        if (currentRoute != navigationItem.route) {
                            selectedItem = index
                            // ... Navigation Stuff
                    },
                    imageVector = navigationItem.icon,
                    label = navigationItem.title,
                    containerColor = Color.Transparent
                )
            }
        }
    }
